# Skillmap drafts

This folder contains drafts for the new skillmap format.

As of writing (2024-06-27) there are two main alternatives:

1. Using a [single file](./skillmap-new-single-file/skillmap-)
2. Using a [modular approach](./skillmap-new-modular/) (each unit has its own file)

Out of the two, going modular seems to be the most maintanable option, especially for more lengthy courses. Keeping everything in a single file becomes messy very quickly.

There is also a [generated skillmap](./skillmap-new-modular-dd1396-chatgpt/) for DD1396. This was done using Chat GPT-4o, with each unit generated separately. 

For reference, the [old format](./skillmap-old/) is also included.
