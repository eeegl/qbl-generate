Your task is now to evaluate the questions by critiquing them thoroughly.

First give an unordered bullet list of the critique. Focus on the things that would give the most improvement, not what is already good.

Then, improve the questions based on the list.

Mark the critique section with "CRITIQUE:" and the improved questions with "IMPROVED QUESTIONS:".
