questions:
  - number: 1
    type: "Multiple Choice Question"
    question: "Which of the following is a characteristic of the Go programming language?"
    skills:
      - skill: "Identify characteristics of the Go programming language"
    options:
      - answer: "Automatic garbage collection"
        feedback: "Correct! Go has automatic garbage collection to manage memory."
        correct: yes
      - answer: "Manual memory management"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Go uses automatic garbage collection for memory management."
        correct: no
      - answer: "Limited concurrency support"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Go is known for its strong support for concurrency."
        correct: no

  - number: 2
    type: "Multiple Choice Question"
    question: "How is the Go playground best described?"
    skills:
      - skill: "Understand the purpose of the Go playground"
    options:
      - answer: "An online tool for trying out Go code snippets"
        feedback: "Correct! The Go playground allows users to write and run Go code online."
        correct: yes
      - answer: "A local integrated development environment (IDE) for Go"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The Go playground is an online tool, not a local IDE."
        correct: no
      - answer: "A feature for debugging Go applications"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The Go playground is primarily used for coding and testing snippets."
        correct: no

  - number: 3
    type: "Multiple Choice Question"
    question: "Which statement is true about Go compared to Java?"
    skills:
      - skill: "Differentiate between Go and Java"
    options:
      - answer: "Go is compiled to machine code directly"
        feedback: "Correct! Go is compiled directly to machine code, unlike Java."
        correct: yes
      - answer: "Java is a statically typed language like Go"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While both languages are statically typed, Java compiles to bytecode."
        correct: no
      - answer: "Go uses the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Go does not rely on the JVM like Java does."
        correct: no

  - number: 4
    type: "Multiple Choice Question"
    question: "What feature of Go distinguishes it from Python?"
    skills:
      - skill: "Compare Go with Python"
    options:
      - answer: "Static typing"
        feedback: "Correct! Go is statically typed, unlike Python which is dynamically typed."
        correct: yes
      - answer: "Interpreted execution"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Go is compiled, not interpreted like Python."
        correct: no
      - answer: "Built-in garbage collection"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Both Go and Python have built-in garbage collection."
        correct: no

  - number: 5
    type: "Multiple Choice Question"
    question: "How does Go handle concurrency in comparison to Python?"
    skills:
      - skill: "Understand concurrency in Go compared to Python"
    options:
      - answer: "Go uses goroutines for concurrency"
        feedback: "Correct! Go utilizes lightweight goroutines for concurrent programming."
        correct: yes
      - answer: "Python uses threads for concurrency"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Python's threading model is different from Go's goroutines."
        correct: no
      - answer: "Both Go and Python rely on processes for concurrency"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Go's goroutines offer a different concurrency model compared to Python."
        correct: no
